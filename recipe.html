        </p>
        <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
        <p>1/2 cup / 8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick), melted</p>
        <p>4 fat garlic cloves, grated 1/2 cup Parmesan, grated</p>
        <p>1/4 cup firmly packed chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        <p>Black pepper</p>
        <p>1 bagette of rustic crusty loaf</p>
        <p>1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced (optional)</p>
        <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
        <p>Heat the oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together 
            the butter, garlic, Parmesan and parsley. Add the salt and 
            generously season with salt and pepper. Set aside while you 
            cut the baguette.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
        <p>Cut deep slits into the baguette, 1-inch apart — don’t cut all 
            the way through the loaf — and place the baguette on a large 
            piece of foil. Using a teaspoon or an offset spatula, generously 
            spread the seasoned butter inside each slit. Make sure to reach 
            the bottom of the slit; don’t be shy here.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3</b></p>
        <p>Wrap the baguette in the foil, place on a baking sheet and bake 
            for 15 minutes. Remove the baguette from the oven and unwrap the 
            top (leave the bread on the foil). If you’re adding mozzarella, 
            use the offset spatula or spoon to gently open each slit and tuck 
            a piece of mozzarella in (it’s O.K. if the cheese pops out from the 
            top a little). Return bread to the oven and bake until crisp and 
            golden on top, another 5 minutes. Slice with a serrated knife (or 
            tear with your hands) and serve at once.</p>
